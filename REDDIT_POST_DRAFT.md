## **Title:**
"Built a local context manager that gives your Ollama models persistent memory - ContextVault"

## **Post Content:**

Hey r/LocalLLaMA! ðŸ‘‹

I've been frustrated with the fact that every conversation with my local models starts from scratch - they never remember who I am, what I'm working on, or my preferences.

So I built **ContextVault** - a local-first context management system that gives your Ollama models persistent memory while keeping your data completely private.

## **What it does:**

âœ… **Context Injection**: Automatically injects relevant context into your prompts  
âœ… **Permission System**: Granular control over what each model can access  
âœ… **Local-First**: All data stays on your machine  
âœ… **CLI Interface**: Easy command-line management  
âœ… **REST API**: Programmatic access for integration  

## **Quick Demo:**

```bash
# Add some context about yourself
./contextvault-cli context add "I'm a Python developer who loves testing and debugging"

# Give your model permission to access preferences
./contextvault-cli permissions add mistral:latest --scope="preferences,notes"

# Start the proxy (runs on port 11435)
./contextvault-cli proxy

# Now use Ollama through the proxy
curl -X POST "http://localhost:11435/api/generate" \
  -d '{"model": "mistral:latest", "prompt": "What do you know about me?"}'
```

**Before ContextVault:** "I don't have any information about you..."  
**After ContextVault:** "Based on our previous interactions, you're a Python developer who loves testing and debugging..."

## **Why this matters:**

- **Privacy**: Your context never leaves your machine
- **Efficiency**: No more repeating yourself in every conversation
- **Control**: Fine-grained permissions per model
- **Integration**: Works with any Ollama model

## **Current Status:**

âœ… **Fully functional** - I've tested every component  
âœ… **Permission system** working  
âœ… **Context injection** working  
âœ… **CLI and API** working  

## **What's Next:**

Planning to add MCP integrations (Calendar, Files, Email) so your models can access real user data locally.

## **Try it:**

GitHub: [link]
Installation: `git clone && ./contextvault-cli init`

**Questions:**
- What integrations would be most valuable to you?
- How do you currently handle context/memory with local models?
- Any feedback on the approach?

Thanks for checking it out! This community has been amazing for learning about local AI, so I wanted to give back with something useful.
